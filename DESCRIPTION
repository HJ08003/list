Description: This package allows researchers to conduct multivariate 
	statistical analyses of survey data with list experiments. In 
	addition, the package implements the statistical test that is 
	designed to detect certain failures of list experiments. This 
	survey methodology is also known as the item count technique or 
	the unmatched count technique and is an alternative to the commonly 
	used randomized response method. The package implements the methods
        developed by Imai (2011), Blair and Imai (2012), Blair,
        Imai, and Lyall (2013), and Imai, Park, and Greene (2014). 
	This includes a Bayesian MCMC implementation of regression 
	for the standard and multiple sensitive item list experiment 
	designs and a random effects setup, a Bayesian MCMC hierarchical 
	regression model with up to three hierarchical groups, the 
	combined list experiment and endorsement experiment regression 
	model, and a joint model of the list experiment that enables
	the analysis of the list experiment as a predictor in 
	outcome regression models.
